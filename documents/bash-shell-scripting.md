###### ðŸ‘‰ Note: so as shown above its bash shell, so we are good to go with bash shell scripting...
### âž¤ 
    
### âž¤ to run/execute the script file
###### ðŸ“’ Note: to run the execute command as below the file should have the persmission a executable file (checkout the ```chmod``` to change the permissions)

###### ðŸ‘‰ Note: so as shown above its the .sh file is executing the ```ls -l``` command which is the content of the .sh file

#### Important points to note;
###### âž¤ The file extensions should always be a .sh, it can anything like apple, script.txt, README.md etc...
###### âž¤ The file should have the executable permission like ```-rwxrwxr-x```.
###### âž¤ Since the file extension can be anything, to alert the interpretor that this is a bash script file we use ```#!/bin/bash``` (called as ```shebang```) as the first line of the scripting file

#### Breaking down the ```#!/bin/bash``` (```shebang```)
##### ```#!``` âž  tells the shell what interpreter to use while executing the script. And this is applied only for the first line of the file as in other line the # is considered as ```comment```
##### ```/bin/bash```Tells that the type of shell will be used to run the script. In this case, the script should be interpreted and executed by "bash" shell, which is same as when we run ```echo $SHELL``` command.
